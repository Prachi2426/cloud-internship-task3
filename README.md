#  Task 3 – Multi-Cloud Architecture (CodTech Internship)

This repository contains my implementation and documentation for **Task 3: Design a Multi-Cloud Architecture**, completed as part of the **CodTech IT Solutions Cloud Computing Internship** (May 20, 2025 – July 20, 2025).

---

##  Objective

To design and document an architecture where services are distributed across **two cloud platforms** (AWS and GCP), demonstrating interoperability, scalability, and platform independence.

---

##  Tools & Platforms Used

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services):**
  - S3 (Storage)
  - Lambda (Processing)
  - IAM (Access control)

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**
  - Cloud SQL (Relational database)
  - Cloud Functions (Event handling)
  - Cloud Monitoring (Optional)

---

##  Summary

-  AWS was used for storage and compute operations.
-  GCP handled database and function-based automation.
-  Data flows between AWS and GCP were designed to support API communication and logging.
-  IAM policies and secured endpoints were planned on both platforms.

---

##  Key Benefits of Multi-Cloud

- Reduces **vendor lock-in**
- Improves **fault tolerance and redundancy**
- Offers **cost optimization** by choosing the best services from each provider
- Promotes **scalability** and flexibility in deployment

---

##  Deliverables

- Multi-cloud architecture diagram (included)
-  Report/documentation explaining platform roles and service interaction
